# Select AI for Python


Select AI for Python enables you to ask questions of your database data using natural language (text-to-SQL), get generative AI responses using your trusted content (retrieval augmented generation), generate synthetic data using large language models, and other features â€“ all from Python. With the general availability of Select AI Python, Python developers have access to the functionality of Select AI on Oracle Autonomous Database.

Select AI for Python enables you to leverage the broader Python ecosystem in combination with generative AI and database functionality - bridging the gap between the DBMS_CLOUD_AI PL/SQL package and Python's rich ecosystem. It provides intuitive objects and methods for AI model interaction.
